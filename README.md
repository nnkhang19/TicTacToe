# Tic Tac Toe
## Introduction
This project builds a tic tac toe game with two levels: easy and hard.

## Game interpretion
The game is played between player and comp. <br />
### 1. Easy level
The computer plays the game by choosing a random empty cell to put its letter down.

### 2. Hard level
In this level, the bot makes a move after playing a several simulation games to figure out the best choice for the current state of the game. This approach is based on the minimax algorithm (link : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

## Game interface
The interface is built by tkinter library in python.
